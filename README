HOW TO USE

	CONVERT FROM SPREADSHEET TO SORTABLE HTML TABLE - LINUX/MACOS ONLY
	run 'python sheet2table.py input.odf output.html'
	Current version only works on machines with openoffice installed on linux
	for the spreadsheet -> .csv conversion. Also you'll probably have to 
	play with the ooffice paths to get ssconverter.py working esp if on macos.
	If you can't get it working export to .CSV and use csv2html.py.
	
	CONVERT FROM .CSV TO SORTABLE HTML TABLE - ALL OS - WINDOWS
	run 'python csv2html.py input.csv output.html'
	Input must be a .csv file. Most spreadsheet programs can export their
	native filetype to .csv.

	CONVERT FROM SPREADSHEET TO .CSV -LINUX/MACOS ONLY
	run 'python ssconvert.py input.odf output.csv'

FILE DESCRIPTIONS

	TABLESTYLE.CSS is a css file where you can edit the appearance
	of your table. You will need to recreate a new output.html every time
	you edit this file.

	TEST.OSD is a sample spreadsheet to test the code on.

	CSV2HTML.PY converts a .csv file into an html file containing
	css and javascript. It can be run independantly.

	SHEET2TABLE.PY converts a spreadsheet file into an .html file.
	It has a dependency on csv2html.py and ssconverter.py. It can be run
	independantly.

	SSCONVERTER.PY converts a spreadsheet file into an .csv file.
	It has a dependancy on ooutils.py. It can be run independantly.

	OOUTILS.PY provides functionality to access open office utils
	from python. It has a dependancy on open office.

	
KNOWN BUGS
	
	SSCONVERTER.PY cycles through a dict (p) looking for the correct
	open office dirs. Currently there are only three entries in that
	list so in all likelihood ssconverter.py will have an error on 
	your os. You can try finding the correct paths and adding it to
	the p dict in ssconverter.py. Failing that, you can export your
	spreadsheet to a .csv- most GUI spreadsheet programs allow this-
	and use csv2html.py instead
