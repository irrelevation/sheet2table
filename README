HOW TO USE

	CONVERT FROM SPREADSHEET TO SORTABLE TABLE - LINUX/MACOS ONLY
	run 'python spread2table.py input.odf output.html'
	Current version only works on machines with openoffice installed on linux
	for the spreadsheet -> .csv conversion. Also you'll probably have to 
	play with the ooffice paths to get ssconverter.py working esp if on macos.
	If you can't get it working export to .CSV and use csv2html.py.
	
	CONVERT FROM .CSV TO SORTABLE TABLE - ALL OS - WINDOWS
	run 'python csv2html.py input.csv output.html'
	Input must be a .csv file. Most spreadsheet programs can export their
	native filetype to .csv.
